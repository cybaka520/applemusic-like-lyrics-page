<div align=center>

A lyric player component library aims to look similar to iPad version of Apple Music. Also with[ DOM](./packages/core/README.md),[ React ](./packages/react/README.md)and[ Vue ](./packages/react/README.md)bindings. [Also there's a local player based on it!](./packages/player/README.md)

This's maybe the most like iPad Apple Music style lyric page you've seen in frontend.

Although the goal of this project is not to imitate it completely, it will polish some details better to be better than currently the best lyric players.

## Performance configuration reference

PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS HAVE SHOWN THAT ALL MAJOR CPU PROCESSORS WITHIN FIVE YEARS CAN DRIVE THE LYRICS COMPONENT AT 30FPS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO RUN SMOOTHLY AT 60FPS, MAKE SURE THE CPU FREQUENCY IS AT LEAST 3.0Ghz OR ABOVE. If you need smooth operation above 144FPS, make sure the CPU frequency is at least 4.2Ghz or above.

GPU performance is capable of running at full 60 fps at the expected size under the following conditions:
